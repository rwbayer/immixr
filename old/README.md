IMMIXR is an open-source social media aggregation tool that makes it easy to display all of your social feeds in one place, seamlessly.

IMMIXR is currently still under development (starting from scratch after the successful CalHacks demo), so check back soon-ish to be able to put your social media feeds into your personal site for free.

Check out [my blog](http://rwbayer.com/blog/technology/projects/2015/01/09/immixr/) for more information.
